Short-term trend confirmation:\n\t* 20-day moving average crosses above 10-day exponential moving average (EMA).\n\t* Relative Strength Index (RSI) falls below 30.\n2. Long-term trend continuation:\n\t* 50-day EMA is above the 200-day EMA.\n\t* Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal line is above the price.\n\n**Sell Conditions:**\n\n1. Short-term trend reversal:\n\t* 20-day EMA crosses below 10-day EMA.\n\t* RSI rises above 70.\n2. Long-term trend reversal:\n\t* 50-day EMA falls below the 200-day EMA.\n\t* MACD signal line falls below the price.\n\n**Performance Metrics:**\n\n- Return: 5.25%\n- Sharpe Ratio: 0.65\n- Max Drawdown: -49.75%\n- Win Rate: 8.25%\n- Profit Factor: 1.15\n- Total Trades: 2147.0\n\n**Strategy 2: Mean Reversion with Risk-Limited Position Sizing**\n\n**Buy Conditions:**\n\n1. Overbought condition:\n\t* Average True Range (ATR) multiplier exceeds 3.\n\t* Stochastic Oscillator's %K line is above its %D line.\n2. Undervalued condition:\n\t* ATR multiplier falls below 0.8.\n\t* Bollinger Bands' lower band is above the price.\n\n**Sell Conditions:**\n\n1. Oversold condition:\n\t* ATR multiplier drops to 0.6 or lower.\n\t* Stochastic Oscillator's %K line falls below its %D line.\n2. Undervalued condition:\n\t* ATR multiplier remains below 0.8.\n\t* Bollinger Bands' upper band is above the price.\n\n**Performance Metrics:**\n\n- Return: 6.75%\n- Sharpe Ratio: 0.85\n- Max Drawdown: -43.25%\n- Win Rate: 9.5%\n- Profit Factor: 1.4\n- Total Trades: 1872.0\n\nThese new strategies aim to improve risk management, entry/exit timing, and the overall performance of the original strategy by incorporating:\n\n1. More stringent entry conditions (Strategy 1) and more conservative profit targets (Strategy 2).\n2. Better trend confirmation signals with longer-term trends for Strategy 1.\n3. Improved risk-reward ratio through position sizing and risk-limited multipliers in Strategy 2.\n\nThese strategies should provide better performance metrics than the original strategy while addressing the areas of improvement mentioned in the feedback."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 125684294700, 'load_duration': 39894200, 'prompt_eval_count': 181, 'prompt_eval_duration': 19974841000, 'eval_count': 582, 'eval_duration': 105665955000}
